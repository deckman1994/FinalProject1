/// i'm not lying when I say this: I used only my code and everything is mine, Derek Eckman.
//I had the hardest time with saving the information of .addemployee and .addmanager to the vector and then searching them. I even emailed two students at whitworth that are CS majors and they had a hard time with figuring out what I was trying to do with my pointers and saving to a vector.
//I really enjoy c++ when I get it and the struggle with this was I just simply didnt believe your videos helped me but the emails back and forth helped more.
//My favorite thing part of this class was that I can now (to the best of my ability) code projects that fit my life and make fit my specific type of problems I run into.
